# Minecraft Server Status Client

This is a web to check the status and current online players of my friend's Minecraft server.
Back-end hosted in Heroku and Front-end hosted here in github pages.
I use react CSS modules for the styling and ant design just to test it.

I use mc-ping library in the Backend: https://github.com/Cryptkeeper/mc-ping-updated

------
### Why?
I did it to start learning NodeJs, express and practice ReactJs and to make something fun for my friends. The server its very simple but it serves his purpose and I found that heroku its a great tool for hosting backend projects.

The Back-end and the Front-end are separated in different repositories.
